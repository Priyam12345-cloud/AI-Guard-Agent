        "# Task\n",
        "Design and implement an AI guard agent using a laptop's webcam, microphone, screen, and speakers to monitor a room. The agent should activate via a spoken command, recognize trusted individuals using face recognition, and engage in an escalating spoken conversation with unrecognized individuals to deter intrusion. The project should integrate pre-trained AI models for speech recognition, text-to-speech, face recognition, and conversational AI, focusing on integration rather than model training. The implementation should use Python 3.8+ and free, open-source libraries, and can be developed on Google Colab or a local machine. The project will be completed in three milestones: Milestone 1: Activation and Basic Input, Milestone 2: Face Recognition and Trusted User Enrollment, and Milestone 3: Escalation Dialogue and Full Integration."
